        <p align="justify"> <i id="palabs">The goal of active learning algorithms is to judiciously select subsets of unlabeled samples to be labeled by an oracle, in order to reduce the time and cost associated with supervised learning. Previously, active learning techniques for deep neural networks have used the same network for the task at hand (e.g., classification) as well as sample selection,  which  can  be  conflicting  goals.   To  address  this issue,  we  use  a  separate  sample  scoring  network  to  capture the relevant information about the distribution of the labeled samples,  and use it to assess the novelty of unlabeled samples.  Specifically, we propose to efficiently train the scoring network using a self-supervised learning (pre-text)  task  on  the  labeled  samples.    To  make  the  scoring network more robust, we added to it another head, which is trained using the supervised (task) objective itself.  The scoring network was paired with a scoring function that allows an appropriate trade-off between the two heads.  We also ensure that the selected samples are diverse by selectively fine-tuning the scoring network in sub-rounds of each query round.  The resulting scheme performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on benchmark datasets.  More importantly, in realistic scenarios when some labels are erroneous and new classes are introduced on the fly, the performance of the proposed method remains strong.</i></p>

        <p align="justify"> <i id="droccabs">Classical approaches for one-class problems such as one-class SVM and isolation forest require careful feature engineering when applied to structured domains like images. State-of-the-art methods aim to leverage deep learning to learn appropriate features via two main approaches. The first approach based on predicting transformations (Golan & El-Yaniv, 2018; Hendrycks et al., 2019a) while successful in some domains, crucially depends on an appropriate domain-specific set of transformations that are hard to obtain in general. The second approach of minimizing a classical one-class loss on the learned final layer representations, e.g., DeepSVDD (Ruff et al., 2018) suffers from the fundamental drawback of representation collapse. In this work, we propose Deep Robust One Class Classification (DROCC) that is both applicable to most standard domains without requiring any side-information and robust to representation collapse. DROCC is based on the assumption that the points from the class of interest lie on a well-sampled, locally linear low dimensional manifold. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that DROCC is highly effective in two different one-class problem settings and on a range of real-world datasets across different domains: tabular data, images (CIFAR and ImageNet), audio, and time-series, offering up to 20% increase in accuracy over the state-of-the-art in anomaly detection. DROCC's code is available at <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/EdgeML/">https://github.com/Microsoft/EdgeML/</a>.</i></p>

        <p align="justify"> <i id="lpsabs">The  Global  Navigation  Satellite  Systems  (GNSS)like  GPS  suffer  from  accuracy  degradation  and  are  almostunavailable in indoor environments. Indoor positioning systems(IPS)   based   on   WiFi   signals   have   been   gaining   popularity.However,  owing  to  the  strong  spatial  and  temporal  variationsof  wireless  communication  channels  in  the  indoor  environment,the  achieved  accuracy  of  existing  IPS  is  around  several  tens  ofcentimeters. We present the detailed design and implementationof a self-adaptive WiFi-based indoor distance estimation systemusing  LSTMs.  The  system  is  novel  in  its  method  of  estimatingwith  high  accuracy  the  distance  of  an  object  by  overcomingpossible  causes  of  channel  variations  and  is  self-adaptive  tothe  changing  environmental  and  surrounding  conditions.  Theproposed design has been developed and physically realized overa WiFi network consisting of ESP8266 (NodeMCU) devices. Theexperiments were conducted in a real indoor environment whilechanging the surroundings in order to establish the adaptabilityof  the  system.  We  compare  different  architectures  for  this  taskbased  on  LSTMs,  CNNs,  and  fully  connected  networks  (FCNs).We  show  that  the  LSTM  based  model  performs  better  amongall the above-mentioned architectures by achieving an accuracyof5.85cm  with  a  confidence  interval  of93%on  the  scale  of(8.46m x6.98m). To the best of our knowledge, the proposedmethod outperforms other methods reported in the literature bya  significant  margin.</p>

        <p align="justify"> <i id="spieabs">Magnetic resonance (MR) images (MRI) are routinely acquired with high in-plane resolution and lower through-plane resolution. Improving the resolution of such data can be achieved through post-processing techniques knows as super-resolution (SR), with various frameworks in existence. Many of these approaches rely on external databases from which SR methods infer relationships between low and high resolution data. The concept of self super-resolution (SSR) has been previously reported, wherein there is no external training data with the method only relying on the acquired image. The approach involves extracting image patches from the acquired image constructing new images based on regression and combining the new images by Fourier Burst Accumulation. In this work, we present four improvements to our previously reported SSR approach. We demonstrate these improvements have a significant effect on improving image quality and the measured resolution.</p>

        <p align="justify"> <i id="dpacabs"> Hardware-in-the-loop simulations are very commonly used to test controller design and monitor how the controller responds, in real time, to realistic virtual stimuli. In an HIL simulation, a real-time computer is used as a virtual representation of the plant model and a real version of the concerned controller. Most of these dynamical systems are in the form of coupled differential equations, and digital computers tend to be terribly slow at iteratively approximating solutions to such systems. The notion of using analog computing grids to efficiently solve differential equations (in hardware) has been well accepted in the research fraternity, and proves to be a faster way to solve linear dynamical systems.
        In this project, we demonstrate a digitally programmable analog computer, which can solve linear dynamical systems with upto 5 state variables. The system is capable of working in real time, since there are no moving parts once the configuration is set and the system is programmed. The system is capable of being driven by upto 5 forcing functions, and can represent any linear dynamical system upto order 5.
        It consists of active devices to implement integrators, gain blocks and inverter blocks using operational amplifiers, along with passive components to emulate the system matrix. These blocks will be linked together using analog switches which would be controlled by signals given by a microcontroller. For our first prototype, we assume B and C to be identity, for the sake of simplicity.
        In this report, we present the design philosophies, layout descriptions, experimental results and analyses of two prototypes ㅡ DPAC-𝜷 and DPACv1.0. The DPAC-𝜷 is a miniature version of the DPACv1.0, to emulate second order systems, and features a block-modular structure and mechanical switches, allowing easy configuration of the system matrix and operational parameters. The DPACv1.0 features a single PCB, is interfaced and controlled using a microcontroller, and is capable of solving the linear dynamical system in real time.</p>
